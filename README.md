Vim Configuration
======

The purpose of this repository is simply to serve as a way to centrally manage a few basic VIM settings. You are free to use any of the provided information contained in this repository in your own configurations if you like. If you do have any suggestions or ideas on how to improve these settings, feel free to contact me. I am always curious to learn more about VIM and how to finetune it.
